   Then look for the folder named `fps-example` that you just downloaded, open it and wait for Unity to generate the files it needs.
4. When the project is open, in the menu above click on **Assets > Import Packages > Characters**

    and then click on **Import** in the window that pops up. This will import all the assets we need to run the game.
5. Finally in the **Project** tab click on the folder *Scenes* right under *Assets* and double click on the file **FloorWithCubes** to open the scene. Now you can just click on the **PLAY** button and shoot those cubic assholes!

## How it works
You are just a simple guy with a fancy gun. Let's shoot those punk cubes and turn them green! (I hate cubes)
